    <h1 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:black">Why Spotify Premium?</h1>


<pre style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: black">Subscribing to Spotify Premium is a great way to get rid of pesky ads,
    
    but there is more to the paid version of the service than you might expect. Here is why Spotify Premium might be worth it for you.

    No advertisements anywhere: this includes both audio and banner ads.

    Better audio quality: if you are an audiophile, Spotify Premiumâ€™s upgrade from 160kbit/s to 320kbit/s could be well worth it.

    Downloading songs (sort of): Spotify Premium allows you to download songs for offline listening. If you cancel your subscription,
     however, you will no longer have access to them.

    Unlimited skipping and no forced shuffling on the mobile app. '

    The free version of Spotify shuffles all playlists and even adds single tracks to shuffled playlists,
    
    while only giving you six skips per hour. 

    This only happens on the mobile apps, but its frustrating regardless. With Spotify Premium.

     however, you can skip to your hearts content.

    Ad-supported Hulu access: You can have this bonus feature if you live in the US.</pre>
